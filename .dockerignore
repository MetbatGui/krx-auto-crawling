# Exclude docker directory itself (optional, but good practice if not needed in build context)
# docker/ 
# -> We need docker/Dockerfile if we build from root, but here context is root and dockerfile is in docker/.
# If we exclude docker/, the builder might not find the Dockerfile if it's passed as argument but excluded from context? 
# Actually Dockerfile path is separate from context. But usually we don't need docker config inside the image.
